# Main Greenhouse Documentation

**Description:**  
This document serves as the master reference for all documentation related to the construction, programming, and operation of the automated greenhouse. It, along with subsequent documentation files, is written in a detailed and accessible style to support individuals of varying skill levels in successfully implementing the project.  

Please note that a basic level of prior knowledge is required, including fundamental crafting skills, beginner-level programming, intermediate computing concepts, and basic electrical skills (e.g., soldering and wiring).
