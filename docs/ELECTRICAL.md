# Greenhouse Electrical Wiring

The electrical components that distribute power and logical execution of the greenhouse are contained within the electronic enclosure.

For power distribution, there are three main components:
1. Compact surge protector (3 outlets)
    * NOTE: If the specific surge protector (or any compact surge protectors), an alternative is potentially an AC distribution block with custom wiring application
2. 
3.
