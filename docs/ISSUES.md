# Known Issues

1. Inadequate temperature regulation:
    a. No ability to effectively trap air inside
    b. No air conditioning within greenhouse
2. No implementation of soil sensors
3. No tie-in of soil readings to watering protocols
4. No proper mounting bracket of ventilation fans to plastic wrapping
5. Gaps in plastic wrapping near the electornics enclosure
6. No testing in outside environment
7. Custom cut-out wiring guiding PVC for lights needed

# Potential Solutions

1a-1b. The main culprit is cutting the plastic wrap on the longer side to create an entrance into the greehouse. The following could be potential solutions:
    * Keep greenhouse completely enclosed; access could be a process where maintainers lift the entire greenhouse enclosure to the side.
    * Potential issues with this approach is that any physical access to the plants will require atleast 2 people (or 1 person with really wide arms)
    * Another potential issue is certain sensors and tubing that is attacheed to the soil bed (soil sensor, watering system)
        * This could be circumvented with detachable parts outside of the enclosure
    * Another solution is stitched plastic flaps with potentially a zipped running along the gap to ensure a tighter fit than velcro.
    * Potential issue is that this could be very expensive and time consuming
1b. No heating or cooling element available for this scale and power budget
    * Make our own heating and cooling element?
    * Potential issue is cost and safety (especially with heating)
    * Maybe solution is to do simple heating and allow passive cooling?

4. Print a mount that goes on the outwardly facing side of each fan. Wide flat area to help tape the 3d print to the plastic wrap.
6. Testing plan:
    * Outdoor test enclosure only
    * Outdoor housing only testing?
    * TODO...
7. Pretty simple - reuse the 4-way T split connector and remake it into a 3-way T split connector.
    * Potentially use PVC glue in this case or some kind of glue that can bind PVC and PLA/PETG
