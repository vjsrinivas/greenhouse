# Objective

### What Exactly Are We Building in This Project?

- A semi-automated greenhouse designed to fit in an average-sized classroom.
- The greenhouse will be capable of performing the following tasks autonomously:
	- Turn grow lamp(s) on or off based on total light exposure required for the selected crop type.
	- Activate or deactivate the water pumping system for drip-based irrigation.
	- Ventilate and heat the interior using fans and a small heating element.
	- Collect environmental data (ex: light, soil moisture, and temperature)
- These actions will be triggered based on:
	- Predefined schedules programmed into a central computer.
	- Real-time sensor readings.
